"""The write seam: where collected items go.

A channel fetches; the runner orchestrates; a **Sink** decides the destination.
Today the only destination is the legacy ``collected_records`` table
(``LegacyDbSink``). Next, the same items also flow to the ODP hot path
(``OdpSink``), and both at once for shadow validation (``DualSink``) — all behind
this one interface, chosen per source by ``write_strategy``, with no change to
channels or the runner.

This is the strangler-fig seam: the old path keeps working unchanged, the new
path is wired in beside it, and a source is migrated by flipping its strategy —
never by rewriting the pipeline.

    Counts share one vocabulary across sinks, but each is defined relative to
    that sink's OWN durable boundary — not a shared one. A DualSink comparison
    must account for the boundaries differing:

      * ``accepted``   — items the sink committed to its durable path. For
        ``LegacyDbSink`` this is rows inserted into ``collected_records``; for
        ``OdpSink`` it is events the ingest service *queued* (Redis Stream) —
        a weaker guarantee than an inserted row.
      * ``duplicates`` — items the sink recognized as already-seen before its
        durable write (legacy: ``content_hash`` hit; ODP: ``(source_id, event_id)``).
      * ``rejected``   — items dropped for validation or a permanent error;
        detail in ``errors``.
      * ``normalized`` — items that passed normalization (legacy bookkeeping).
      * ``records``    — persisted ORM rows, for sinks that own a local table
        (``LegacyDbSink``), so the downstream AI/notify steps can enrich them.
        Forward-only sinks (``OdpSink``) leave it empty and those steps no-op,
        because on the ODP path enrichment happens off the ``record.committed``
        stream.
      * ``shadow_meta`` — set only by ``DualSink``: the best-effort shadow
        leg's OWN ``accepted``/``duplicates``/``rejected`` counts (the top-level
        fields above stay the legacy/authoritative leg's numbers so existing
        callers are unaffected). ``None`` when there is no shadow leg, or when
        the shadow write raised before producing a result. Previously these
        counts were only logged (P1-7); this lets a caller (pipeline.py)
        surface them without changing what "accepted"/"duplicates" mean.
