    ``forward_to_odp`` gates a forward to the Rust ODP ingest hot path (fires
    only when ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` is ALSO set). Defaults to False: the ODP
    forward is opt-in, chosen explicitly by the write-seam layer under a
    source's ``write_strategy`` (``OdpSink`` / ``DualSink``, see
    ``backend/pipeline/sinks/strategy.py``), not an implicit side effect of a
    bare env var being present (P1-1). Previously this defaulted to True, so
    setting ``ODP_INGEST_URL`` anywhere forwarded every ``legacy``-strategy
    source's data into ODP too — bypassing the write_strategy state machine
    entirely and silently enrolling sources that were never migrated.
    ``LegacyDbSink`` (the ``legacy`` strategy's sink) now passes this
    explicitly; nothing should rely on the old implicit-True default.

    ``identities`` (C7), when given, is a list parallel to ``normalized_triples``
    (same length, index-aligned) of each item's channel-provided ``identity()``
    value, or None for items the channel can't identify. It is a SUPPLEMENTARY
    key alongside content_hash, not a replacement:
      - identity present AND matches an existing row for this source: that's
        the same source-native item seen before. If its content_hash is
        unchanged, it's a plain duplicate (skipped). If the content_hash
        differs (e.g. the feed fixed a typo in the title), the existing row
        is UPDATED in place instead of inserted as a new row — a title edit
        no longer duplicates the item (the C7 bug). Updated rows are folded
        into the returned new_records (their content actually changed, so
        downstream AI enrichment/notification should see them as fresh).
      - identity present but not matching any existing row: falls through
        to the normal content_hash-based insert path, with identity_key set
        on the new row so future edits can be matched.
      - identity None (or ``identities`` not given at all): behavior is
        completely unchanged — content_hash-only dedup, exactly as before
        C7. This is the only path channels without identity() ever take.
