"""PackManifest — the ``channel.manifest.json`` schema (Browser Act integration decision #5).

This is the machine-readable execution contract that ``BrowserActChannel``
(PR-C) interprets generically: ``steps`` is a sequence of browser-act
operations to run for one page of results, ``param_schema`` describes what
the caller must/may supply, ``pagination`` describes how to fetch subsequent
pages, and ``success`` describes when a result is trustworthy enough to
return. The channel is a generic interpreter of this manifest — it never has
per-pack code.

This module defines the schema + loader. Browser-driven packs can ship a
``channel.manifest.json`` beside their ``SKILL.md``; API-backed packs remain
outside this interpreter because they need a distinct HTTP execution shape.
Field sets are deliberately permissive/optional per-op (see ``Step``)
since a single step in the sequence only uses a subset of fields.
